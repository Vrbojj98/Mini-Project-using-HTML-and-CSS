# Mini-Project-using-HTML-and-CSS
So My first Mini Project after starting my Actual Web Development Journey 1.5 weeks ago.

This Mini-Project is based on HTML and CSS and is basically Playing with Shapes and colours.

This Mini project has helped me understand the Application of following KEY CONCEPTS :-
1) How to use Flex. 
2) Margin and Padding.
3) How to use Box models, Classes , IDs , selectors , colors , etc.

I know this mini project is very basic though...but will gradually Increase the level of the Game✌️...So stay tuned for my Upcoming projects 🙌🏻
